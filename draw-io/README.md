Experiment with Draw.io

It seems possible to generate suitable CSV data from a user-maintainable spreadsheet in a way that the flow relationships are maintainable.

A couple things that are missing:
* No obvious way to group a number of nodes within a container, e.g. to represent that systems that are hosted in an particular environment
* Autmatic rendering makes distributes the nodes reasonable, but with a lot of nodes and edges (say upwards of eight) and curved lines are very messy and then confusing to manually tweak.

Seems very useful for some less complex tasks, but not so good for our data flow diagram.
